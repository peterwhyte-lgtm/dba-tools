/*
Script Name : Get-MemoryGrantSpills
Category    : performance
Purpose     : Top queries by memory grant spills to TempDB. Spills occur when SQL grants
              less memory than a sort or hash join operator needs, forcing intermediate
              results to disk. Invisible in wait stats — shows as TempDB I/O pressure
              or RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE waits. Needs the total_spills column, which arrived in
              SQL Server 2016 SP2 and 2017 CU3, so the script detects the column rather than
              testing a version number.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-query-performance-deep-dive/)
Requires    : VIEW SERVER STATE (VIEW SERVER PERFORMANCE STATE is enough on SQL Server 2022 and later)
Notes       : total_spills counts 8 KB pages. Ad-hoc and sp_executesql statements carry no dbid in
              sys.dm_exec_sql_text, so the database comes from the plan's compile database instead;
              filtering on the text's dbid alone dropped every ad-hoc and prepared spill.
              The diagnosis reads averages, so a query that spills on some executions only can
              still average over the CRITICAL line; max_spills_single_exec shows the worst run.

-- total_spills/max_spills arrived in SQL Server 2016 (13.x) SP2 and 2017 (14.x) CU3, NOT in
-- 2016 RTM. A major-version test cannot gate this anyway: the whole batch is bound before any
-- IF runs, so a static reference to a missing column fails to compile and the friendly message
-- never prints. Detect the column, and keep the query in dynamic SQL so it is only bound when
-- it can succeed. Same pattern as Get-CdcAndChangeTracking.
