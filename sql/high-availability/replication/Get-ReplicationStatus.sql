Script Name : Get-ReplicationStatus
Category    : high-availability
Purpose     : Lists all publications and subscriptions from the distribution database, including
              publication type, subscriber server and database, subscription type, and status.
              Finds the distribution database automatically and returns a status row when
              this instance is not a Distributor, so it is safe to run from master on any instance.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-replication-status/)
Requires    : db_owner or replmonitor role on the distribution database
HealthCheck : Yes
