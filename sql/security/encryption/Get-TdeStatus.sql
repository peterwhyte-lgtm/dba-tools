Script Name : Get-TdeStatus
Category    : security
Purpose     : Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) status across all databases. Includes
              encryption state, key algorithm, encryptor type, and tempdb encryption
              side-effect awareness.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-certificates-keys-and-tde-status/)
Requires    : VIEW SERVER STATE (2022+: VIEW SERVER SECURITY STATE is enough), plus VIEW ANY DEFINITION for certificate_name and certificate_expiry (NULL without it)
