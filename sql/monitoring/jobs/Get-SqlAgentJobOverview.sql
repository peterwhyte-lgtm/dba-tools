Category    : configuration-and-environment
Purpose     : Show all SQL Agent jobs with enabled state, owner, and last run outcome.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-sql-agent-job-overview/)
Requires    : db_datareader on msdb, plus VIEW ANY DEFINITION to resolve job owner names (the job rows return either way; an owner only resolves if that login is visible to you)
