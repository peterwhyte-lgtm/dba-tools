Script Name : Fix-OrphanedUsers
Category    : migration
Purpose     : Generate ALTER USER statements to re-map orphaned database users to their
              matching server-level logins across all user databases. Run on TARGET after
              databases are restored and logins are created.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-fix-orphaned-users/)
Requires    : VIEW ANY DEFINITION and CONNECT ANY DATABASE (or sysadmin). Stops with an error
              without VIEW ANY DEFINITION; a database it cannot connect to is listed as
              NOT A COMPLETE SCAN

-- PERMISSION GUARD. Without VIEW ANY DEFINITION, metadata visibility hides rows instead of
-- raising an error, and both failures were measured on the lab 2026-10-05:
--   CONNECT ANY DATABASE alone: every database's users are invisible, so the script printed
--     "No orphaned users found. All database users map to a valid server login." over 112
--     real orphans.
--   a user with VIEW DEFINITION in one database: sys.server_principals shows only the caller,
--     so every mapped user in that database came out as a false "Cannot auto-fix" orphan, and
--     every other database stayed silent.
-- A missing CONNECT is loud (the per-database catch below), so only this one needs a guard.

/*
  DESIGN: After restoring databases from a source server, SQL logins are re-created with the
  same SID (via Generate-LoginScript.sql WITH SID = ...). This means SQL-authenticated users
  are NOT orphaned: their SID in sys.database_principals matches the new login's SID.

  Windows-authenticated users are also fine because the AD SID never changes. They are NOT
  scanned here: their authentication_type_desc is WINDOWS, not INSTANCE (the same filter as the
  MS Docs orphaned-user query), and a Windows user with no login of its own can still connect
  through a Windows group login. Recreate a missing Windows login with CREATE LOGIN ... FROM
  WINDOWS and the user remaps itself on the AD SID, no ALTER USER needed.

  The orphan case that CAN occur:
    - SQL logins created without SID preservation (e.g. the old login was dropped and re-created
      and the SID therefore differs from what is stored in the restored database).
    - Databases restored from an environment where logins no longer exist on the new server.

  This script generates ALTER USER ... WITH LOGIN statements for any user in any database whose
  SID does not match any login on this instance. It assumes login name = user name (common case).
  Review the output before executing; not every orphan can be fixed with a simple name match.

  This script never applies a fix. It RETURNS the ALTER USER statements as text for you to
  review and run yourself, which is why it is classed ReadOnly. There are no commented-out
  EXEC lines to uncomment: the one EXEC sp_executesql below collects the orphan list, it does
  not repair anything.
