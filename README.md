## What This Is

I'm Peter Whyte — production SQL Server DBA, running [sqldba.blog](https://sqldba.blog). This is the toolkit I actually use, and it's built around one idea: **collect everything a DBA looks at on a server, then have an AI review it with you.**

The core workflow is three steps. A health check collection runs 45 diagnostic scripts against an instance and saves each result as a CSV. A rules review turns those CSVs into deterministic CRITICAL / WARNING / INFO findings. Then an AI assessment reads the whole collection and does what fixed thresholds can't — correlates findings across the CSVs into root causes and writes a prioritized report with evidence and a fix for each issue. It's a second reviewer that has read every output, doesn't get tired, and surfaces the blindspots you'd miss at 2am.

Underneath that sits everything else a production DBA needs, usable on its own:

- **192 SQL scripts** you open and paste directly into SSMS — no parameters, no magic variables, no install
- **PowerShell wrappers** that run the same scripts from the terminal and export CSVs
- **A local web UI** where collections are viewed, verified, and diagnosed — health scorecard, security drill-down, disk capacity, AI reports, live incident triage
- **Runbooks, change orders, and a migration toolkit** for the planned work when there's time to do it right

Every script came from a real situation: an incident, a migration window, a client handover, or a routine check that needed to be fast and safe. It runs against localhost by default, a named instance when you pass one, or a server list via the multi-server scripts.

Everything is read-only by default. Every script has a header with what permissions it needs and what it touches. Nothing phones home, nothing requires a framework — and nothing is sent to any AI until you run the assessment step yourself.

## Start Here

Clone the repo and run the setup script. This assumes a local SQL Server is installed, no flags needed:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/peterwhyte-lgtm/dba-tools
cd dba-tools
.\Initialize-Environment.ps1
```

This checks PowerShell version, installs the SqlServer module if missing, creates output directories, and verifies the connection. Pass or fail, it tells you exactly what to do next.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/01-init-terminal.png" alt="Initialize-Environment output" width="720">
</p>

To target a remote or named instance instead, pass `-ServerInstance`:

```powershell
.\Initialize-Environment.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2025
```

Once setup passes, the server is saved for the session and every script picks it up automatically — no `-ServerInstance` flag needed on each run.

## The Health Check — Collect, Review, AI-Assess

The flagship workflow. Three commands take a server from "no idea" to a prioritized written assessment:

```powershell
.\powershell\reporting\Invoke-HealthCheckCollection.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2025   # 1. collect
.\powershell\reporting\Review-HealthCheckOutput.ps1                                      # 2. rules review
.\powershell\reporting\Invoke-AiAssessment.ps1                                           # 3. AI assessment
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/04-healthcheck-findings.png" alt="Health check review findings" width="720">
  <br><em>Review-HealthCheckOutput — CRITICAL / WARNING / INFO findings across the instance</em>
</p>

**Step 1** collects 45 scripts in a single pass — backups, waits, blocking, memory, disk, security surface area, agent jobs, integrity checks, and more — into one timestamped folder of CSVs.

**Step 2** applies fixed rules: missing or stale backups, databases not online, stale DBCC CHECKDB, suspect pages, sa enabled, percent-based autogrowth, unconfigured max server memory, I/O latency above threshold, transaction log pressure, high VLF count, maintenance job failures.

**Step 3** is the point of the collection. The AI reads every CSV and correlates what the rules can't: the missing index findings that line up with the top CPU queries, the autogrowth history that explains the VLF count, the weak login that's also a sysadmin. The output is a written report — verdict, priority issues with evidence and a fix for each, security posture, watch list — saved to `output-files\assessments\`.

Two ways to run the AI step, both driven by the same rubric:

- **Claude Code in your editor** — open the repo, sign in, and ask for a health assessment. No key handling.
- **The API script** — `Invoke-AiAssessment.ps1`, scriptable and schedulable. Works with a personal key at home or a corporate key/gateway at work; nothing account-related is stored in the repo. `-DryRun` writes the exact prompt to a file without calling any API, so a corporate review can see byte-for-byte what would be sent.

Setup for both paths, including the corporate data-review question: [docs/ai-assessment.md](docs/ai-assessment.md)

For a client handover or ownership review, there's also a scored markdown report with no AI dependency:

```powershell
.\powershell\reporting\Invoke-AssessmentReport.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2025 -AssessedBy "Peter Whyte"
```

## The Web UI — View, Verify, Diagnose

A local browser dashboard where collection output is viewed and signed off. One Collect action feeds every page:

```powershell
.\web-ui\Start-WebUi.ps1
# Opens at http://localhost:8787
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/05-web-ui-scripts.png" alt="Web UI running in VS Code terminal alongside the browser" width="720">
  <br><em>VS Code terminal (bottom) running Start-WebUi.ps1, browser UI (top) — browse scripts by category, search, and run against any instance</em>
</p>

- **Health Check** — scorecard with severity and category filters, plus a findings delta against the previous collection: what's new, what's resolved
- **Security** — surface area and access-risk vitals with three-level drill-down, from a count to the CSV rows to remediation T-SQL
- **Disk** — capacity through two lenses: % used worst-first across all databases, and the top databases by absolute size
- **AI Assessment** — read reports in the browser, or run a new assessment from a panel
- **Triage** — a live incident cockpit: run diagnostic scripts and see results inline, mid-incident
- **Scripts** — the browse/reference library for the whole repo

Runs on `localhost:8787` only. The server itself has no external dependencies; the browser chart view loads Chart.js from a CDN. The UI is optional: every workflow above works from the terminal alone. A multi-server fleet dashboard is on the roadmap.

## The MCP Server — This Reference, As Tools Your AI Can Call

Everything above assumes you are the one asking. `mcp/` ships the same reference as an
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server, so an AI assistant can look things up here instead
of answering from memory — which is where confident, wrong SQL Server answers come from.

```powershell
pip install "sqldba-mcp @ git+https://github.com/peterwhyte-lgtm/dba-tools.git#subdirectory=mcp"
```

Six tools, and the ceiling is deliberate — a test fails the build if a seventh appears:

| Tool | Answers |
|---|---|
| `lookup_error` | an error number, or a phrase from the message |
| `explain_wait` | a wait type, and whether it is worth chasing |
| `check_build` | a build number, version year or pasted `@@VERSION` → CU, KB, support dates |
| `find_script` | "which script does X", with the safety class attached |
| `get_script` | the script body, verbatim from this repo |
| `answer_question` | an operational how/why question, from published write-ups |

- **It never connects to your SQL Server.** No connection string, no driver, no `run_script` tool.
  The datasets ship inside the package, so it works on an air-gapped box.
- **Every answer carries its source URL**, so anything it tells you can be checked.
- **It refuses rather than guessing.** Asked something outside SQL Server, it says so. That refusal
  is the product, and it is measured rather than claimed — see `mcp/tests/real_questions.py`, which
  asks from outside the corpus rather than rewording the corpus back at itself.

The reference behind the tools is the blog's pillar libraries: the
[Error Library](https://sqldba.blog/sql-server-errors/), the
[Wait Types Library](https://sqldba.blog/sql-server-wait-statistics/), the
[builds and support lifecycle list](https://sqldba.blog/sql-server-builds-complete-version-list-and-support-lifecycle/),
and the [DBA Scripts hub](https://sqldba.blog/scripts/).

## PowerShell — Run From The Terminal, Save To CSV

The same scripts, callable by name from any directory. No paths, no module dependencies beyond the SqlServer module.

```powershell
# Run any script by name — fuzzy match. Results always saved to output-files/ as CSV.
.\run.ps1 Get-WaitStatistics
.\run.ps1 Get-BlockingChains -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2025
.\run.ps1 Get-BackupCoverage -OutputFormat Csv  # CSV only, no terminal output

# Set a server once for the session — every script picks it up
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2025
.\run.ps1 Get-WaitStatistics
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/screenshots/03-run-ps1-output.png" alt="run.ps1 in action" width="720">
  <br><em>.\run.ps1 — resolves any script by name, outputs to terminal or CSV</em>
</p>

## Operational Runbooks

`docs/ops/` covers the planned work — the things you need to get right before and during a maintenance window, not the things you're diagnosing in the moment.

**Change orders** — CAB-ready approval documents for version upgrades, server migrations, and AG failovers. Pre/post checks and rollback criteria included.

**Execution checklists** — step-by-step guides for AG cluster migration, standalone server replacement, DR failover, and SQL version upgrades. Written for the person executing, not the person reviewing.

**Runbooks** — full playbooks covering standalone migration, AG cluster migration, OS upgrade, edition change, and version upgrade. What to do, in what order, with decision points for when things go sideways.

**Change templates** — SQL for TDE, CDC, mirroring, AG configuration, statistics maintenance, DBCC patterns, and patching. Copy the template, fill in the variables, review before executing.

### Migration Toolkit

Run against the source server before a migration window:

```powershell
# Pre-migration risk scan — HIGH/MEDIUM/INFO findings across compat, features, logins, config
.\powershell\migration\Invoke-PreMigrationAssessment.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2025

# Capture baseline metrics for before/after comparison
.\powershell\migration\Export-MigrationBaseline.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2025 -Label pre
```

Covers: compatibility gaps, deprecated features in active use, edition-only features, linked server dependencies, AG membership, login inventory with migration risk, post-migration validation checklist.

## Requirements

| | Minimum | Recommended |
|-|---------|-------------|
| SQL Server | 2016 (13.x) | 2019+ |
| PowerShell | 7 | 7+ |
| SQL execution | `sqlcmd.exe` on PATH | SqlServer module (`Invoke-Sqlcmd`) |
| Permissions | `VIEW SERVER STATE`, `VIEW ANY DATABASE` | Same |

The SQL scripts themselves need no PowerShell at all — open them from `sql/` and paste into SSMS. The
tooling around them (`run.ps1`, the wrappers, the health check) uses PowerShell 7 syntax; `run.ps1`
hands off to `pwsh` automatically if you start it from Windows PowerShell 5.1, but `pwsh` has to be
installed. `winget install Microsoft.PowerShell`.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name SqlServer -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

The AI assessment step additionally needs either Claude Code (signed in) or an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — see [docs/ai-assessment.md](docs/ai-assessment.md). Everything else runs fully local.
