# Script catalog

Every SQL script and every PowerShell script with real logic in this repo, grouped by the folder it
actually lives in. Descriptions are the `Purpose` line from each script's own header, so this list and
the scripts cannot drift apart.

- **Post** links to the companion write-up on sqldba.blog where one exists. A blank Post column means
  the script works exactly the same, it just has not been written up yet.
- **Writes** marks the scripts that are not read-only: `CreatesObjects` creates jobs, tables, or XE
  sessions; `WritesData` changes data. Everything unmarked is read-only and safe to run in production.
- **HC** marks the 45 scripts collected by `Invoke-HealthCheckCollection.ps1`.

Every SQL script here is single-result-set and paste-and-run in SSMS. To run one from the terminal
instead, use `.\run.ps1 <ScriptName>` — see [quick-start.md](quick-start.md).

## SQL scripts

### Inventory — `sql/inventory/`

What is on this instance: version, OS, databases, services, logins, jobs, linked servers.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-DatabaseInventory` | Inventory user databases for migration readiness — compatibility level, recovery model, state. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-database-inventory/) |  |  |
| `Get-DatabaseSnapshotInventory` | Lists all database snapshots with source database, age, and allocated size — snapshots silently consume filegroup space if forgotten. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-database-snapshot-inventory/) |  |  |
| `Get-DatabaseSummary` | One-row-per-database view of every database on the instance: state, recovery model, log reuse wait, file sizes, backup currency, and configuration flags. Notes column aggregates actionable issues. Reads from system metadata and msdb only — no per-database scan. For used vs free space detail run Get-DatabaseSizesAndFreeSpace. For file-level detail run Get-DatabaseFilesDetail. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-database-summary/) |  |  |
| `Get-Databases` | Lists all databases with key properties and allocated file sizes. Reads from system metadata only — fast, no per-database scan. Data and log sizes reflect allocated file space, not space used. Run Get-DatabaseSizesAndFreeSpace for used vs free breakdown. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-database-sizes-and-free-space/) |  |  |
| `Get-JobInventory` | Inventory SQL Agent jobs with owner for migration dependency checks. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-login-and-job-inventory/) |  |  |

An active but misconfigured RG can silently throttle queries or starve the DBA's own sessions on an inherited server. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-trace-flags-and-resource-governor/) |  |  |
| `Get-SilentFailureAudit` | Find the SQL Server problems that never raise an error. One row per finding across integrity, backup chain, constraint trust, statistics, security and Agent jobs, with why each one stays silent and what to do about it. Run when taking over an instance. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/sql-server-silent-failures/) |  |  |
| `Get-SqlServerCpuTopologyAndSchedulerDetails` | CPU topology, NUMA layout, scheduler summary, and parallelism configuration in one row. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-cpu-topology-and-os-config/) |  |  |

| `Get-SuspectPages` | Show any pages recorded in msdb.dbo.suspect_pages — evidence of I/O or corruption errors. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-suspect-pages-and-integrity-checks/) |  | yes |

### Monitoring: space and growth — `sql/monitoring/disk-space/`

Database and file sizing, free space, filegroups, volumes, transaction log, VLFs, autogrowth history and forecast.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-AutogrowthHistory` | Reads autogrowth events from the SQL Server default trace. Autogrowth events during business hours indicate undersized files; frequent events indicate the growth increment is too small. Use this to right-size initial file sizes and growth increments. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-autogrowth-history/) |  | yes |
| `Get-DatabaseFilesDetail` | Show per-file details for all user databases: path, size, max size, growth settings. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-sql-server-database-file-details/) |  | yes |
| `Get-DatabaseFreeSpaceSummary` | Allocated, used, and free space for all online databases, ordered by total free space descending. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-database-free-space-summary/) |  |  |
| `Get-DatabaseGrowthEvents` | Show recent autogrowth events from the default trace for capacity planning. |  |  |  |
| `Get-DatabaseGrowthForecast` | Project when database files will exhaust their configured size limits, using historical file size changes recorded by the DatabaseGrowth temporal collector. Calculates MB/day growth rate from the first and last observed size within the window, then projects forward to the configured file limit. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-database-growth-risk-and-forecast/) |  |  |
| `Get-DatabaseGrowthRisk` | Flag databases approaching their configured file size limits. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-database-growth-risk-and-forecast/) |  | yes |
| `Get-DatabaseSizesAndFreeSpace` | Data and log file sizes with used and free space for all online user databases. Uses dynamic SQL so FILEPROPERTY runs inside each database's own context, where it correctly reports allocated vs used pages. The original CTE approach querying sys.master_files from master caused FILEPROPERTY to return NULL for other databases' files. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-database-sizes-and-free-space/) |  | yes |
| `Get-DiskSpace` | Show free and used space per volume that hosts SQL Server database files. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/script-check-disk-space-on-sql-server/) |  | yes |
| `Get-FilegroupSpace` | Allocated, used, and free space per filegroup across all online databases — ordered by lowest free percentage first. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-filegroup-space/) |  |  |
| `Get-LogReuseWaits` | Reports why each database's transaction log cannot truncate and reuse space — the log_reuse_wait_desc reason per database, with recovery model, log size, and last log backup for context. This is the first question to answer when a log file is full or growing and won't shrink. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-log-reuse-waits/) |  |  |
| `Get-TransactionLogSizeAndUsage` | Show transaction log size, used space, free space, and percent used per database. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-transaction-log-size-and-usage/) |  | yes |
| `Get-VlfCount` | Reports virtual log file (VLF) count per database transaction log, ranked by severity. High VLF counts degrade recovery time, log backup performance, and redo during AG synchronisation. Often caused by many small autogrowth events accumulating over time. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-vlf-counts/) |  | yes |

### Monitoring: TempDB — `sql/monitoring/tempdb/`

TempDB configuration, file balance, usage, and live hotspots.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-TempDbConfiguration` | Reviews TempDB file configuration — file count, sizing parity, autogrowth settings, and max server memory context. Surfaces common misconfigurations that cause allocation contention on busy OLTP servers. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-temp-db-configuration/) |  | yes |
| `Get-TempDbFileBalance` | TempDB data file configuration — checks for size imbalance, growth mismatches, percent-based growth, and file count vs CPU count. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-temp-db-usage-and-file-balance/) |  |  |
| `Get-TempdbHotspots` | Identify sessions consuming the most TempDB space for contention and spill triage. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-temp-db-hotspots/) |  |  |
| `Get-TempdbUsage` | Show TempDB file sizes, free space, and allocation breakdown per file. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-temp-db-usage-and-file-balance/) |  | yes |

### Monitoring: SQL Agent — `sql/monitoring/jobs/`

Job overview, failures, schedules, duration trends, alerts and operators.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-AgentAlertsAndOperators` | SQL Agent alerts and operators with severity gap analysis. Surfaces instances with no alerts for severity 19-25 (critical errors go unnoticed without these). | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-agent-alerts-and-operators/) |  |  |
| `Get-JobDurationTrends` | SQL Agent job duration over the last 30 days — flags jobs that are running significantly longer than their average. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-job-schedules-and-duration-trends/) |  |  |
| `Get-JobScheduleSummary` | Show enabled SQL Agent jobs with their schedules and next scheduled run time. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-job-schedules-and-duration-trends/) |  |  |
| `Get-SqlAgentJobFailureSummary` | Show SQL Agent job failures from the last 7 days with readable timestamps and error messages. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-sql-agent-job-failure-summary/) |  | yes |
| `Get-SqlAgentJobOverview` | Show all SQL Agent jobs with enabled state, owner, and last run outcome. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-sql-agent-job-overview/) |  | yes |

### Monitoring: error log — `sql/monitoring/error-log/`

Recent entries, categorised patterns, and schema-change history from the default trace.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-ErrorLogPatterns` | Reads the current SQL Server error log and groups entries by category — surfaces memory pressure, login failures, IO issues, corruption warnings, and auto-growth events without scrolling through raw entries. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-error-log-patterns/) |  |  |
| `Get-RecentErrorLogEntries` | Show SQL Server error log entries from the last 24 hours, filtering routine noise. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-recent-error-log-entries/) |  | yes |
| `Get-SchemaChangeHistory` | Recent DDL changes (CREATE, ALTER, DROP) captured by the SQL Server default trace — answers "what changed on this server recently?" after an incident or unexpected behaviour. Requires the default trace to be enabled (on by default). Covers the rolling window kept by the trace files. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-schema-change-history/) |  |  |

### Monitoring: features — `sql/monitoring/features/`

CDC and Change Tracking, Query Store, Extended Events, Service Broker, Database Mail, compression, collation and cross-database dependencies.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-CdcAndChangeTracking` | CDC (Change Data Capture) and Change Tracking enabled databases with retention, cleanup settings, and latency indicators. Both features impact transaction log growth and can stall if cleanup jobs are absent or delayed. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-cdc-and-change-tracking/) |  | yes |
| `Get-CollationConflicts` | Databases whose collation differs from the server collation — a common source of implicit conversion errors and failed JOIN operations. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-collation-conflicts-and-cross-database-dependencies/) |  |  |
| `Get-CompressionCandidates` | Largest uncompressed tables and heaps in the current database, ordered by reserved space — identifies the best candidates for row or page compression. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-compression-candidates/) |  |  |
| `Get-CrossDatabaseDependencies` | Objects in the current database that reference other databases via 3-part names or linked servers — critical to find before a migration, rename, or decommission. Note: only captures statically-resolvable references. Dynamic SQL built at runtime will not appear here. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-collation-conflicts-and-cross-database-dependencies/) |  |  |
| `Get-DatabaseMailQueue` | Database Mail items that are failed, retrying, or unsent — plus last 24 hours of sent mail for context. Shows error detail for failed items. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-service-broker-health-and-database-mail-queue/) |  |  |
| `Get-ExtendedEventsSessions` | Active Extended Events sessions — name, state, targets, and estimated disk impact. Surfaces unexpected or high-overhead XE sessions on inherited servers. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-extended-events-sessions/) |  | yes |
| `Get-QueryStoreStatus` | Query Store enablement, fill ratio, capture mode, and health across all user databases. Surfaces databases where QS is off, full, or auto-switched to READ_ONLY. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-query-store-status/) |  | yes |
| `Get-ServiceBrokerHealth` | Service Broker health across all user databases. Orphaned/disconnected conversation endpoints accumulate silently over months, eventually degrading SB infrastructure. SB is implicitly active on many instances (Database Mail, AG health checks use it). Surfaces conversation endpoint counts by state, transmission queue depth, and queue activation status. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-service-broker-health-and-database-mail-queue/) |  | yes |

### Performance (root) — `sql/performance/`

Wait statistics, database I/O, table sizes, and live backup/restore progress.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-BackupRestoreProgress` | Show active backup/restore progress and estimated completion for long-running operations. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-backup-restore-progress/) |  |  |
| `Get-DatabaseIoUsage` | Database I/O totals with percentage share, MB read/written, and latency breakdown. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-database-io-usage/) |  | yes |
| `Get-TableSizes` | Largest tables across all online user databases by total size (data + index). Essential for getting to know a new instance — identifies the major data consumers and tables most likely to impact I/O, backup times, and index maintenance windows. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-table-sizes/) |  |  |
| `Get-WaitStatistics` | Top wait types since last SQL Server restart, filtered to actionable waits only. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/sql-server-wait-statistics/) |  | yes |

### Performance: active sessions — `sql/performance/active-sessions/`

What is running right now, with or without execution plans.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-ActiveRequests` | Point-in-time snapshot of all active requests — sessions with a request currently in flight. Returns wait type, blocking chain, CPU, reads, writes, elapsed time, TempDB consumption, and the current executing statement. Excludes idle sessions and the diagnostic session itself. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-active-sessions-and-requests/) |  |  |
| `Get-ActiveRequestsWithPlan` | Point-in-time snapshot of all active requests with XML execution plans. Same columns as Get-ActiveRequests.sql with the addition of query_plan from sys.dm_exec_query_plan. Use the PowerShell wrapper to extract plans to individual XML files for SSMS analysis. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-active-sessions-and-requests/) |  |  |
| `Get-ActiveSessions` | Show all active user sessions with current wait type, blocking, elapsed time, and statement. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-active-sessions-and-requests/) |  | yes |
| `Get-LongRunningQueries` | Active requests with elapsed and wait details — ordered by elapsed time descending. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-long-running-queries/) |  |  |
| `Get-WorkerThreadsAndActiveSessions` | Active user sessions with CPU, elapsed time, and current worker thread pool usage. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-worker-threads-and-active-sessions/) |  |  |

### Performance: blocking and locking — `sql/performance/blocking-locking/`

Blocking chains and summaries, open transactions, lock escalation, deadlocks, contention.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-BlockingChains` | Traces all active blocking chains using a recursive CTE. Returns every session involved in blocking — head blockers, mid-chain nodes, and leaf victims — ordered so each chain reads depth-first. Idle head blockers (sleeping but holding locks) are included; their last executed statement is recovered via sys.dm_exec_connections. Returns no rows when the server is not blocked. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-blocking-chains/) |  |  |
| `Get-BlockingChainsWithPlan` | Same as Get-BlockingChains.sql with the addition of query_plan for every session that has a cached plan. Use the PowerShell wrapper to extract plans to individual XML files. Plan will be NULL for idle head blockers (no active request) and sessions still in parse/compile. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-lock-contention-and-blocking-plans/) |  |  |
| `Get-BlockingSessions` | Show sessions involved in blocking chains with wait type, timing, and current statement. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-blocking-sessions/) |  |  |
| `Get-BlockingSummary` | Head blockers with context — who is blocking, how many sessions, and what they are running. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-blocking-sessions/) |  |  |
| `Get-ContentionAnalysis` | Unified contention summary across lock waits, latch waits, TempDB allocation pressure, and spinlock contention. All figures are cumulative since the last SQL Server restart — high counts on a recently restarted instance are not necessarily concerning. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-lock-contention-and-blocking-plans/) |  |  |
| `Get-DeadlockSummary` | Show recent deadlock events from the system_health XEvent ring buffer. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-deadlock-summary/) |  |  |
| `Get-LockEscalationStats` | Shows tables with the most lock escalations since last restart. Lock escalation converts row/page locks to a table lock, increasing blocking. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-lock-contention-and-blocking-plans/) |  |  |
| `Get-OpenTransactions` | Active transactions with age, session details, and the SQL currently running or last executed — long-running open transactions cause log growth and block readers in READ_COMMITTED isolation. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-open-transactions/) |  |  |

### Performance: indexes — `sql/performance/indexes/`

Missing, unused, duplicate, and fragmented indexes; heaps and index design problems.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-DuplicateIndexes` | Exact duplicate and overlapping (prefix) indexes across all user databases. Duplicates waste storage and double/triple write overhead for every DML operation. Overlapping indexes (A's key columns are a left-prefix of B's) usually mean B makes A redundant. Combines with usage stats to flag duplicates that are also unused — the highest priority to remove. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-duplicate-indexes/) |  |  |
| `Get-Heaps` | Lists tables with no clustered index (heaps) across all online user databases. Heaps cause full table scans on every non-covering lookup, accumulate forwarded records after row updates (degrading IO), and do not reclaim deleted row space without a REBUILD. Common source of hidden IO pressure that grows silently as data volumes increase. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-heaps/) |  |  |
| `Get-IndexDesignIssues` | Tables with index design problems: excessive index count (write amplification), wide key columns (>900 bytes — approaching the 1700-byte nonclustered key limit), and tables where Missing Index DMV has > 3 recommendations (optimizer giving up on existing index coverage). Complements Get-DuplicateIndexes. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-index-design-issues/) |  |  |
| `Get-IndexFragmentation` | Top fragmented indexes across all user databases, ranked by fragmentation pct. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-index-fragmentation/) |  |  |
| `Get-IndexFragmentationAcrossDatabases` | Check index fragmentation details across all user databases for maintenance planning. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-index-fragmentation-across-databases/) |  |  |
| `Get-IndexUsageStats` | Show how indexes across all user databases are being used — seeks, scans, lookups, updates. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-index-usage-stats/) |  |  |
| `Get-MissingIndexes` | Missing index candidates from DMVs, ranked by impact score (seeks x cost x impact). | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-missing-indexes/) |  | yes |
| `Get-UnusedIndexes` | Identifies non-clustered indexes with zero read activity but non-zero write overhead since the last SQL Server restart. These indexes slow every INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE on the table without benefiting any query. Run in the context of the database you want to audit. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-unused-indexes/) |  |  |

### Performance: queries — `sql/performance/queries/`

Top CPU and I/O queries, slow queries, plan cache health, implicit conversions, memory grant spills, statistics health.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-ImplicitConversions` | Scans the plan cache for implicit conversion warnings. These cause index range scans instead of seeks and generate unnecessary CPU. Most common cause: VARCHAR column compared to NVARCHAR parameter, or INT column compared to VARCHAR. NOTE: scans plan XML — runs for 10–30 seconds on busy servers with large plan caches. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-implicit-conversions/) |  |  |
| `Get-MemoryGrantSpills` | Top queries by memory grant spills to TempDB. Spills occur when SQL grants less memory than a sort or hash join operator needs, forcing intermediate results to disk. Invisible in wait stats — shows as TempDB I/O pressure or RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE waits. Requires SQL Server 2016+ (total_spills column). | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-query-performance-deep-dive/) |  |  |
| `Get-PlanCacheHealth` | Summarises plan cache composition by object type — highlights single-use plan bloat, ad-hoc SQL pressure, and total memory consumption. High single-use percentages indicate parameter sniffing or missing parameterisation. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-query-performance-deep-dive/) |  | yes |
| `Get-QueryVariance` | Queries from the plan cache where max execution time is at least 5x the minimum — the primary signal for parameter sniffing and plan instability. High execution count with high variance means the same query performs very differently depending on the parameter values in the cached plan. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-query-performance-deep-dive/) |  |  |
| `Get-SlowQueriesFromCache` | Top 20 queries by average elapsed time from the plan cache — identifies habitually slow queries. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-top-cpu-queries/) |  |  |
| `Get-StatisticsHealth` | Identifies stale, low-sample, and never-updated statistics in the current database. Returns the UPDATE STATISTICS command per row for direct copy-paste remediation. Run in the context of the target user database. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-statistics-health/) |  |  |
| `Get-StoredProcedurePerformance` | Stored procedures from the plan cache ranked by total elapsed time — shows execution count, average and max duration, CPU, and logical reads. Resets on SQL Server restart or plan eviction. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-query-performance-deep-dive/) |  |  |
| `Get-TopCpuQueries` | List top 20 CPU-consuming queries with execution counts and timing metrics. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-top-cpu-queries/) |  | yes |
| `Get-TopIoQueries` | Top 20 queries by total logical reads since last restart — primary I/O pressure source. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-top-cpu-queries/) |  |  |

### Performance: Query Store — `sql/performance/query-store/`

Top queries, regressions, and forced plans from Query Store.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-QueryStoreForcedPlans` | Forced plans in Query Store with failure counts, plan age, forcing reason, and whether the forced plan is still the cheapest available option. A force_failure_count > 0 means QS is silently reverting to natural plans — queries you think are protected are not. Run in the context of the target database (-Database <dbname>). | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-query-store-regressions-and-forced-plans/) |  |  |
| `Get-QueryStoreRegressions` | Queries that regressed in the last 24 hours vs their 7-day average CPU/duration. Uses Query Store time-bucketed runtime stats to detect "what changed today" — queries running >2x slower or using >2x more CPU than their recent baseline. Run in the context of the target database (-Database <dbname>). | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-query-store-regressions-and-forced-plans/) |  |  |
| `Get-QueryStoreTopQueries` | Top queries from Query Store by CPU, duration, execution count, or plan regressions. Change @sort_by at the top to switch modes. Must run in the context of the target database — change the database in SSMS or pass -Database <dbname> via the PS wrapper. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-query-store-top-queries/) |  |  |

### Backups and recovery — `sql/backups/`

Coverage, history, chain integrity, encryption, size trend, restore history, and backup/restore DDL generators.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Generate-DiffBackupScript` | Generate a DIFFERENTIAL backup script for all online user databases. @ts in the generated script resolves at execution time so filenames include the backup timestamp, not the script generation timestamp. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-generate-backup-and-restore-scripts/) |  |  |
| `Generate-FullBackupScript` | Generate a FULL backup script for all online user databases. @ts in the generated script resolves at execution time so filenames include the backup timestamp, not the script generation timestamp. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-generate-backup-and-restore-scripts/) |  |  |
| `Generate-RestoreScript` | Generate a RESTORE DATABASE script for all online user databases. Set @ts to the timestamp of the backup files you want to restore before executing. Review WITH MOVE if restoring to a different server. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-generate-backup-and-restore-scripts/) |  |  |
| `Generate-TLogBackupScript` | Generate a transaction log backup script for all online user databases in FULL or BULK_LOGGED recovery model. SIMPLE recovery databases are excluded — log backups are not supported for them. @ts in the generated script resolves at execution time so filenames include the backup timestamp, not the script generation timestamp. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-generate-backup-and-restore-scripts/) |  |  |
| `Get-BackupChainIntegrity` | LSN continuity analysis for each user database. Verifies the log backup chain from the most recent full backup to now is unbroken. A gap in the log chain means point-in-time restore is impossible for that window — coverage scripts only check recency, not continuity. Also surfaces damaged backup sets. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-backup-chain-integrity/) |  |  |
| `Get-BackupCoverage` | Review backup coverage per database with a status flag for quick health assessment. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-backup-coverage/) |  | yes |
| `Get-BackupEncryptionStatus` | Shows TDE status and backup encryption coverage per database. Identifies databases where TDE is on but backups are not encrypted, or where neither TDE nor backup encryption is used. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-backup-encryption-status/) |  |  |
| `Get-BackupRestoreCompletionTime` | Monitor active backup and restore operations with estimated completion time. |  |  |  |
| `Get-BackupRestoreDurationEstimate` | Analyze backup duration and throughput metrics from msdb for performance baseline. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-backup-restore-duration-estimate/) |  |  |
| `Get-BackupSizeTrend` | Monthly backup size trend per database over the last 12 months — an indirect proxy for data growth rate. Shrinking backups can indicate unexpected data loss; growing backups inform storage planning. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-backup-size-trend/) |  |  |
| `Get-DatabaseBackupHistory` | Review detailed backup history for all databases over the last 2 months. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-database-backup-history/) |  |  |
| `Get-LastDatabaseBackupTimes` | Display the latest backup timestamp per type (Full, Differential, Log) per database. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/get-last-database-backup-times-in-sql-server/) |  | yes |
| `Get-LastRestoreHistory` | Full restore history from msdb — when each database was last restored, from which backup, and by whom. Use to verify DR restore tests have actually been run. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-last-restore-history/) |  |  |
| `Get-RecoveryModelAudit` | Audits each database's recovery model against its actual backup posture and flags the mismatches that cause real incidents: FULL/BULK_LOGGED databases with no log backups (the log grows until the disk fills), databases with no full backup to anchor a log chain, and SIMPLE databases where someone may be expecting point-in-time recovery they do not have. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-recovery-model-audit/) |  |  |

### Security (root) — `sql/security/`

Surface area, audit specifications, DDL triggers, linked server security, proxies and credentials.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-AuditSpecifications` | SQL Server Audit objects and specifications with compliance gap analysis. SQL Audit (the formal mechanism for SOX, GDPR, PCI-DSS) is completely separate from login monitoring — most inherited servers have none configured. Surfaces missing critical action groups (FAILED_LOGIN_GROUP, privilege changes) and database-level audit specifications across all user databases. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-audit-triggers-and-proxy-credentials/) |  |  |
| `Get-DatabaseMailAndXpCmdShell` | Security surface area audit — xp_cmdshell, CLR, Database Mail, force encryption, and active NTLM connections. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-database-mail-and-xp-cmd-shell/) |  | yes |
| `Get-DdlTriggers` | Server-level DDL triggers. These fire on schema changes (CREATE/ALTER/DROP) and are often unknown to incoming DBAs. Can block DDL, audit changes, or enforce naming conventions — a hidden dependency on inherited servers. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-audit-triggers-and-proxy-credentials/) |  |  |
| `Get-LinkedServerSecurity` | Lists linked servers with their security context — how local logins are mapped to remote logins. Catch-all mappings with stored credentials are the highest-risk configuration. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-linked-servers/) |  | yes |
| `Get-ProxyAndCredentials` | Lists SQL Agent proxies and server-level credentials with their identity and associated subsystems. Proxies that use stored credentials to run Agent steps under a different account are a common privilege escalation path. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-audit-triggers-and-proxy-credentials/) |  |  |

### Security: access — `sql/security/access/`

Role membership, permissions, orphaned users, sysadmins, weak logins, failed logins, login activity.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-DatabasePermissions` | Returns all explicit object- and schema-level GRANT/DENY permissions in the current database. Shows grantee, permission, object, and grantor. Run in the context of each user database — does not iterate across databases. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-permissions-and-role-membership/) |  |  |
| `Get-DatabaseRoleMembers` | List database role memberships across all online user databases. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-permissions-and-role-membership/) |  |  |
| `Get-FailedLoginSummary` | Aggregated failed login analysis from the SQL Server error log and current lockout state per SQL login. Surfaces brute-force patterns and locked accounts. Complements Get-WeakLoginSettings (which checks policy configuration) — this checks what is actually happening. Note: SQL Server 2025 does not write 18456 events to RING_BUFFER_SECURITY_ERROR; xp_readerrorlog is the reliable cross-version source for login failures. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-login-security-audit/) |  | yes |
| `Get-LoginLastActivity` | All SQL and Windows logins with current session status, connection details, and disabled/locked state. Note: SQL Server does not record "last login time" natively without a SQL Server Audit configured. This script shows what is available: current active sessions and login metadata. For historical last-login tracking, enable a Server Audit with LOGIN action group. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-login-security-audit/) |  |  |
| `Get-LoginPermissions` | Show explicit server-level permissions granted or denied to logins. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-permissions-and-role-membership/) |  |  |
| `Get-OrphanedUsers` | Find database users with no matching server login — common after migrations or login drops. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-orphaned-users/) |  | yes |
| `Get-ServerRoleMembers` | List members of every fixed and user-defined server role — the comprehensive server-privilege audit. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-permissions-and-role-membership/) |  |  |
| `Get-SysadminMembers` | List members of the sysadmin fixed server role — the focused privileged-access check (sysadmin only). | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-sysadmin-members/) |  | yes |
| `Get-UserPermissionsAudit` | Audit one login's effective access across the whole instance in a single pass: server roles/connection principals, plus per-database role membership — resolved through the real security token, so nested AD group membership shows up automatically. EDIT @LoginName below before running. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-user-permissions-audit/) |  |  |
| `Get-WeakLoginSettings` | Identify SQL logins with weak security settings: policy off, expiration off, or sa enabled. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-login-security-audit/) |  | yes |

### Security: encryption — `sql/security/encryption/`

Certificates and keys, expiry warnings, TDE status.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-CertificateExpiryWarnings` | All user-managed certificates across server and user databases with days until expiry. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-certificates-keys-and-tde-status/) |  | yes |
| `Get-CertificatesAndKeys` | Server-level certificates and asymmetric keys with expiry, usage detection, and lifecycle risk flags. Certificates created for TDE, AG encrypted endpoints, or linked server auth are commonly created and never monitored. An expired cert doesn't break TDE in memory but prevents restoring the database on another server. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-certificates-keys-and-tde-status/) |  |  |
| `Get-TdeStatus` | Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) status across all databases. Includes encryption state, key algorithm, encryptor type, and tempdb encryption side-effect awareness. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-certificates-keys-and-tde-status/) |  |  |

### High availability: Always On — `sql/high-availability/always-on/`

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-AgFailoverReadiness` | Per-AG, per-database failover readiness with quantified RPO and RTO estimates. Answers "would a failover succeed RIGHT NOW and what would it cost?" RTO = estimated seconds to drain redo queue at current redo rate. RPO = log send queue size (data that would be lost if primary fails now). | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-ag-failover-readiness-and-readable-secondary-usage/) |  | yes |
| `Get-AvailabilityGroupLatency` | Display AG replica synchronization timing, queue health, and replication rates. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/script-check-always-on-availability-group-latency/) |  | yes |

Identifies which replicas allow readable secondary access and whether routing is configured. Returns a status row on standalone instances (no AG). | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-ag-failover-readiness-and-readable-secondary-usage/) |  |  |

### High availability: failover cluster — `sql/high-availability/fci/`

Cluster node availability events.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-LastNodeBlip` | Returns SQL Server error log entries that mention failover, alongside the current instance start time. On an FCI, every node blip causes SQL Server to restart on the receiving node — sqlserver_start_time is when it last came online. If no rows are returned there are no 'failover' entries in the current error log archive; use the PowerShell Get-WinEvent approach to query the Windows Failover Clustering Operational log directly (see blog post). | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-last-node-blip/) |  | yes |

### High availability: log shipping — `sql/high-availability/logshipping/`

Log shipping pair status: backup, copy, and restore stage lag.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Get-MirroringEndpointHealth` | Returns the state, port, role, and authentication configuration of the database mirroring endpoint. If the endpoint is not STARTED, mirroring cannot communicate. Run on both the principal and mirror server during troubleshooting. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-mirroring-endpoint-health-and-status/) |  | yes |
| `Get-MirroringStatus` | Shows health, state, and point-in-time latency for all mirrored databases on this instance. Run on the principal server. Reports operating mode, mirroring state, database size, log send queue, and redo queue. Note: Database Mirroring has been deprecated since SQL Server 2012. Always On Availability Groups are the supported replacement for new deployments. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-mirroring-endpoint-health-and-status/) |  |  |

| `Get-ReplicationStatus` | Lists all publications and subscriptions from the distribution database, including publication type, subscriber server and database, subscription type, and status. Finds the distribution database automatically and returns a status row when replication is not configured, so it is safe to run from master on any instance. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-replication-status/) |  | yes |
| `Get-UndistributedCommands` | Shows the count of commands that have been read from the publisher transaction log but not yet delivered to subscribers. A high and growing count indicates Distribution Agent lag or failure. Run against the distribution database (-Database distribution). | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-replication-agent-status/) |  |  |

### Maintenance — `sql/maintenance/`

Job status plus DDL generators for backup, index maintenance, and housekeeping jobs.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Generate-BackupJobs` | Generates SQL Agent DDL to create three scheduled maintenance jobs: DBA - Backup - FULL daily full backup of all online user databases DBA - Backup - LOG transaction log backups on a short interval (default 15 min) DBA - Backup - Cleanup removes old backup files based on retention policy Edit the parameters section, review the output, then run on the target instance. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-generate-maintenance-jobs/) |  |  |
| `Generate-IndexMaintenanceJobs` | Generates SQL Agent DDL for: DBA - Index Maintenance rebuilds/reorganizes fragmented indexes across all online user databases using LIMITED scan.

Creates the target database and a system-versioned (temporal) collector table if absent, then outputs T-SQL to install a recurring AG replica state MERGE job. Each run upserts current replica and database synchronization state — SQL Server automatically records every change in the paired history table, capturing exactly when replicas became disconnected, unsynchronized, or changed role. On instances with no AG configured, a NO_AG sentinel row is inserted once so the job always succeeds and the table remains queryable. Edit parameters, review output, then run on the target instance. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-collect-health-and-configuration-baselines/) |  |  |
| `Generate-CollectorJob-Blocking` | Generates DDL to create the DBA - Collect Blocking SQL Agent job.

Edit parameters, review output, then run on the target instance. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-collect-performance-baselines/) |  |  |
| `Generate-CollectorJob-QueryStore` | Generates DDL to create the DBA - Collect Query Store SQL Agent job. Creates the target database and collector.QueryStore table if absent, then outputs T-SQL to install a recurring Query Store collection job. The job iterates all online user databases with QS enabled and inserts the top 50 queries by average CPU from the most recently completed runtime stats interval. Databases without QS are silently skipped. Edit parameters, review output, then run on the target instance. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-collect-health-and-configuration-baselines/) |  |  |

| `Generate-CollectorJob-VlfCount` | Generates DDL to create the DBA - Collect VLF Count SQL Agent job. Creates the target database and a system-versioned (temporal) collector table if absent, then outputs T-SQL to install a daily VLF count MERGE job. Each run upserts current VLF counts per database — SQL Server automatically records every change in the paired history table, capturing exactly when VLF counts spiked (autogrowth) or dropped (log maintenance). Edit parameters, review output, then run on the target instance. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-collect-capacity-and-temp-db-baselines/) |  |  |
| `Generate-CollectorJob-WaitStats` | Generates DDL to create the DBA - Collect Wait Stats SQL Agent job.

### Traces (Extended Events) — `sql/traces/`

Create, review, and remove Extended Events sessions. See `sql/traces/README.md`.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Create-DecommissionAuditSession` | Creates an Extended Events session that captures all T-SQL batch, RPC, successful login, and failed login activity against a specific database (or all databases). Use before decommissioning or retiring a database to prove zero usage. Run for at least 5–7 business days to catch batch jobs and end-of-period activity. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-create-decommission-audit-session/) | CreatesObjects |  |
| `Create-LoginActivitySession` | Creates a lightweight Extended Events session that captures every successful and failed login to the server — who, from where, and using which application. Use to answer "who connects to this server" before decommissioning, during security reviews, or to baseline connection patterns. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-create-login-activity-session/) | CreatesObjects |  |
| `Create-SpExecutionSession` | Creates an Extended Events session capturing stored procedure and RPC execution — procedure name, duration, login, and hostname. Use to profile what procedures are called most often, by whom, and how long they take — especially useful before a migration or decommission. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-create-sp-execution-session/) | CreatesObjects |  |
| `Get-ActiveXeSessions` | Shows all currently running Extended Events sessions with their targets and file output paths. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-active-xe-sessions/) |  |  |
| `Get-XeSessionActivity` | Reads and summarises Extended Events file target data for a named session. Returns unique caller combinations (login, hostname, app, database) with occurrence counts and time range. Primary use: reviewing DecommissionAudit or LoginActivity session output to determine if a database or server is still in active use. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-xe-session-activity/) |  |  |
| `Remove-XeSession` | Lists all DBA-created Extended Events sessions (running and stopped) and generates the DDL to stop and drop each one. Copy the remove_cmd value for any session you want to clean up and run it. .xel files on disk are NOT deleted — review them first with Get-XeSessionActivity.sql, then delete manually. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-remove-xe-session/) |  |  |

### Lab — `sql/lab/`

Dev and test only. Never run these against production.

| Script | What it returns | Post | Writes | HC |
|--------|-----------------|------|--------|----|
| `Create-BackupChainScenario` | Build a backup chain that shows every case the differential base behaves differently, so the chain inspector query returns something worth reading instead of one full backup and nothing else. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/sql-server-differential-vs-log-backup/) | CreatesObjects |  |
| `Create-BlockingScenario` | Controlled blocking scenario for testing Get-BlockingChains, Get-BlockingSessions, and blocking analysis tools. |  | WritesData |  |
| `Create-IndexProblemScenario` | Build a database that trips every detection in Get-DuplicateIndexes, Get-IndexDesignIssues and Get-UnusedIndexes, so all three can be demonstrated against visible findings instead of an empty result set. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-duplicate-indexes/) | CreatesObjects |  |
| `Create-OrphanedUserScenario` | Create three deliberate orphaned-user shapes on a LAB instance so Fix-OrphanedUsers can be demonstrated showing every branch it has, instead of the single "cannot auto-fix" line the lab happens to produce today. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-fix-orphaned-users/) | CreatesObjects |  |
| `Kill-BlockingSession` | Template for terminating a blocking session after confirming it is safe to do so. Always run Get-BlockingChains first to identify the head blocker and understand the impact before killing anything. |  | WritesData |  |
| `New-TestDatabases` | Create multiple test databases with randomised names for lab and migration scenarios. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/script-generate-test-databases/) | Creates |  |
| `Remove-BackupChainScenario` | Remove the database and msdb backup history created by Create-BackupChainScenario.sql, and prove both are gone. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/sql-server-differential-vs-log-backup/) | WritesData |  |
| `Remove-IndexProblemScenario` | Remove everything Create-IndexProblemScenario.sql created, and prove it is gone. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-get-duplicate-indexes/) | WritesData |  |
| `Remove-OrphanedUserScenario` | Remove everything Create-OrphanedUserScenario.sql created, and prove it is gone. | [post](https://sqldba.blog/dba-scripts-fix-orphaned-users/) | WritesData |  |
| `Test-MaxdopRecommendation` | Prove the recommended_maxdop logic in Get-MaxdopConfiguration against every branch of Microsoft's published guidance table, not just the topology this machine happens to have. |  |  |  |

## PowerShell scripts

Scripts with real logic — orchestrators, DDL generators, and OS-level tools. The 155 thin wrappers
under `powershell/wrappers/` are not listed here: there is exactly one per SQL script, it carries the
same name, and it does nothing but pass your parameters to the matching `.sql` file. Adding one is
what makes a SQL script appear in the web UI.
