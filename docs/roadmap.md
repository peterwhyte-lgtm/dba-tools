# DBA Scripts Roadmap

## Current state (updated 2026-08-23)

Fully functional production DBA toolkit. The repo has a category-first layout: `sql/` for SQL scripts, `powershell/` for wrappers, orchestrators, and automation (categories mirror `sql/`), and `docs/ops/` for operational runbooks and change templates.

**What is complete:**
- SQL diagnostic layer — 192 scripts across monitoring, performance, high-availability, backups, security, maintenance, migration
- Wrapper layer — 157 thin PS wrappers, one per SQL script, colocated with the web UI
- PowerShell orchestration — healthcheck collection (45 scripts), review, assessment report, multi-server health check
- Migration toolkit — full pre/post assessment, DDL generators (logins, jobs, linked servers, user mappings), baseline export
- Collectors — 12 scheduled collectors as SQL Agent job generators in `sql/collectors/` (PS-based Collect-* retired); `Generate-CollectorAlertJob.sql` + `Get-*Delta.sql` for alerting and snapshot analysis
- Collector analysis — `Get-CapacityProjection.ps1` (days-to-full from collector history), `Compare-ConfigurationBaseline.ps1` (config drift)
- Multi-server scripts — 12 self-contained scripts for fleet-wide operations
- Browser UI — script browser, CSV viewer, triage page, health check runner, security page (surface area vitals + access risk + findings panel)
- Environment setup — `Initialize-Environment.ps1` + `SETUP.md`
- Pester tests — SQL header standards, path resolution, wrapper parity (644 tests, all passing)
- CI — GitHub Actions: Pester, PSScriptAnalyzer, markdownlint, SQL standards audit, secrets scan
- MCP server — `mcp/`: six reference tools (errors, waits, builds, scripts, Q&A), docs as Resources, the health-triage rubric as a prompt; independent package with its own tests, CI (`mcp.yaml`), and scored retrieval eval

## Active backlog

### Phase 3 — Script blog coverage (in progress, Peter-driven)

184 of the 192 SQL scripts now have a published companion post on sqldba.blog. Drafting happens outside this repo; the only thing that lands here is the URL.

For each script that merits a post:

1. Publish to sqldba.blog
2. Set the header `Author` line URL to `https://sqldba.blog/<slug>/` (the only blog link in a header since 2026-08-14)

`docs/script-catalog.md` reads those `Author` lines into its **Post** column, so there is no second list to maintain.

The repo's documentation layer is the script header first (Purpose, Requires, SAFE/IMPACT annotations), then a folder README where a whole area needs orienting — currently `sql/`, `sql/collectors/`, `sql/traces/`, and `sql/migration/`. No per-script READMEs or sidecars.

### Phase 4 — CI and quality gates (complete 2026-06-17)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| GitHub Actions: Pester | ✅ | `Invoke-Pester tests/` on push — SqlHeaderStandards, SqlPathResolution, WrapperParity |
| GitHub Actions: PSScriptAnalyzer | ✅ | Covers all `.ps1` under sql/, powershell/, web-ui/, tools/ |
| GitHub Actions: markdownlint | ✅ | `.markdownlint.jsonc` wired via ci.yaml (excludes CLAUDE.md) |
| GitHub Actions: SQL standards audit | ✅ | `Get-StandardsAudit.ps1 -FailsOnly` — fails CI on any FAIL status |
| GitHub Actions: secrets scan | ✅ | gitleaks on full history |
| SQLFluff | — | Not added — Get-StandardsAudit covers NOLOCK, deprecated views, USE, GO |

---

## Phase 6 — Web UI overhaul (started 2026-07-03)

Objective: the web UI is where script output is viewed, verified, and signed off — and the end
state is diagnosing SQL Server issues from a production DBA's perspective. Staged deliberately
(AI credit/limit pacing); each stage ships and is verified independently. Multi-server dashboard
is acknowledged **future** work beyond these stages.

| Stage | Item | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Data strip** — one collect action, many lenses: shared status strip on Health/Security/Disk/AI pages (server · collected age · 39/39 OK), collection-history dropdown, single Collect button; per-page Run buttons removed | ✅ 2026-07-03 | All lens pages re-render from any selected folder without re-collecting |
| 2 | **AI Assessment page** (`/ai`) — list reports from output-files\assessments (API + claude-code badged), verdict preview, markdown → HTML rendering, Run panel (DryRun always; live run when ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set; guidance link otherwise) | ✅ 2026-07-03 | New `/api/run-ai` endpoint wraps Invoke-AiAssessment.ps1 |
| 3 | **Security drill-down** — 3 levels: clickable vital counts (failed logins, sysadmins, weak logins, orphaned users, certs, surface area) → expandable CSV table → row detail with remediation T-SQL; sysadmin↔weak-login cross-reference flagged inline | ✅ 2026-07-03 | `Build-DrillTable` shared helper; vanilla JS, server-rendered tables |
| 4 | **Health Check scorecard + delta** — severity + per-category chips that filter findings; "N new / M resolved" vs previous collection with expandable lists; findings.csv auto-generated when missing | ✅ 2026-07-03 | Delta = keyed diff of two findings.csv files |
| 5 | **Triage → live incident cockpit** — Get-* entries gain Run ▶ (via /api/run + /api/csv) with results tabled inline; Create-*/Generate-* stay view-first for safety; Scripts stays the browse/reference library | ✅ 2026-07-03 | Mirrors the powershell/diagnostics split in the UI |

## Phase 6.1 — Web UI fixes (started 2026-07-03)

Post-overhaul fixes with a DBA-lens focus: skew-proof visuals and everything ordered by
production DBA usage. Staged; each stage verified against local SQL before pushing.

| Stage | Item | Status | Notes |
|-------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **DBA visual pass** — disk page charts redesigned as two lenses (% used worst-first for all DBs = urgency, skew-proof; top-15 absolute GB = capacity), per-bar severity colours, dynamic chart height; table name-bars sqrt-scaled so small DBs stay visible next to a multi-TB outlier; canonical DBA category order (performance, monitoring, backups, security, HA, …, lab) applied to home page SQL + workflow groups with only top-2 expanded; CSV list groups sorted freshest-first; Health Check + Security pages open with a one-line verdict summary (findings counts / SA · xp_cmdshell · sysadmins · weak logins) | ✅ 2026-07-03 | `Get-CategoryRank` + `$script:SqlCategoryOrder` / `$script:PsCategoryOrder` in Start-WebUi.ps1 |
| 2 | **Quick correctness fixes** — shared `ConvertTo-JsonError` helper for all API handlers (hand-rolled -replace chains missed control chars in SQL error text); direct-PS1 Run ▶ now passes only params the script declares (binding errors / silent-$args, same bug class as run.ps1 alias fix); healthcheck script count derived from Invoke-HealthCheckCollection.ps1 instead of hardcoded 39 | ✅ 2026-07-03 | Suspected unencoded `p=` fetch params turned out fine — values are pre-encoded server-side with `EscapeDataString` |
| 3 | **Clear Output safety** — `output-files\assessments\` exempt from /api/clear-output so AI sign-off reports survive the wipe; confirm dialog says so | ✅ 2026-07-03 | Verified with a non-destructive dry-run of the filter (641 of 647 files deletable, 6 assessment files kept) |
| 4 | **Non-blocking collect + progress** — collector writes per-script `manifest.csv` (label, status, started, finished, duration) rewritten atomically after every status change; `/api/run-healthcheck` launches the collection detached and returns the folder immediately; `/api/status` polls the manifest; data strip shows an inline progress bar (done/total, current script, failures, stall warning) and resumes progress display on page load for in-flight collections — including terminal-launched ones | ✅ 2026-07-05 | Manifest doubles as future scoped-run provenance per the settled scope design; per-script durations captured free (service-broker slowest locally at 12s) |

---

## Health check collection blindspots (added 2026-07-03 — from Peter's production environment)

The AI assessment is only as good as what the health check collection suite gathers
(`Invoke-HealthCheckCollection.ps1`, currently 45 scripts — not sql/collectors/ Agent jobs).
Coverage gaps to add to the suite, in Peter's environment terms; ask Peter for topology
specifics before designing each one.

| Item | Why it's a blindspot | Notes |
|------|----------------------|-------|
| Replication at scale | Republishers, multiple distribution DBs, >100 distribution agent + log reader agent jobs — existing replication scripts aren't built for that volume | Needs agent-job-level health rollup, latency/undistributed commands per publication |
| CDC on AG environments | CDC×AG interaction (capture/cleanup job behaviour across failovers) | Pair with existing Get-CdcAndChangeTracking |
| AG-aware checks | AG is everywhere: node blips, failover history, is-this-the-primary awareness | Checks must know their replica role before judging |
| Backups on secondaries | Tlog + full (copy-only) backups run on the SECONDARY — backup-currency checks must read AG-wide history, not local-only, or primaries false-alarm | Affects Get-BackupCoverage / Get-LastDatabaseBackupTimes rules |
| SQL Server 2025 features | New-version feature usage is an anticipated unknown-unknown | Collection script for 2025 feature adoption/config |

**Collection-scope design — SETTLED 2026-07-05:** one canonical collection, no split and no
`-Scope` param for now. A collection folder is a complete point-in-time snapshot — the delta,
AI assessment, and lens pages all depend on that; partial folders would tax every consumer.
Quick single-question rechecks use the existing per-script path (`run.ps1` / Run ▶). Stage 4
is built manifest-first: the collector writes a per-script `manifest.csv` (label, status,
started, finished) that `/api/status` reads for progress — and that same manifest is the
provenance foundation if multi-server economics ever justify scoped runs with copy-forward.

## Tools enhancements (backlog, no fixed phase)

| Item | Description | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Test-ServerNetwork tool | Port checker that always tests 1433 when a SQL Server is the target; clear messaging for port closed vs DNS not found vs connection refused; useful as a pre-flight before any remote script run | Peter has a port list for AG clusters — update when available |
| AG cluster port checker | Comprehensive port check for AG environments: 1433, RPC (135), mirroring endpoint, AG endpoint, optional named instance browser (1434) | Builds on existing `testing-remote-server-port-connectivity-with-powershell` post |
| Server connection diagnostics | Good terminal output when connecting to a specific or multiple servers — indicate what's being tested, surface failures with actionable messages | Pair with Test-ServerNetwork; consider how this scales to multi-server |
| Multi-server design | Decide consistent pattern for passing server lists to scripts — fleet-wide vs targeted; credential handling; output format with `Server` column prepended | Already partially in `powershell/reporting/multi-server/`; needs a design decision before expanding |
| Error messages as blog content | Any notable error encountered during builds/runs is a candidate for an evergreen post; minimal format — what the error means, the fix, when it happens | Process, not code — add to blog backlog as errors come up |

## Phase 5 — Automation and intelligence (no timeline, unstarted)

These extend the existing collector and reporting infrastructure into scheduled, multi-server, and predictive capability.

### Phase 5 items

| Item | Description | Entry point | Dependencies |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Multi-server collector | Run any named collector against a list of servers in one command | `Invoke-MultiCollector.ps1 -Collector wait-stats -Servers "SVR01,SVR02"` | Existing 12 collectors; multi-server script pattern from `powershell/reporting/multi-server/` |
| Baseline comparison | Load pre/post CSV export sets, diff every metric, flag regressions | `Compare-MigrationBaseline.ps1 -Before .\before\ -After .\after\` | `Export-MigrationBaseline.ps1` already produces source CSVs |
| Trend forecasting | Project when a database or disk will run out of space based on MB/day growth rate | `Get-DatabaseGrowthForecast.sql` (already exists, requires DatabaseGrowth collector) | `Generate-CollectorJob-DatabaseGrowth.sql` must be installed and collecting |
| Assessment scheduling | Run `Invoke-AssessmentReport.ps1` on a schedule, email the output | SQL Agent job or Task Scheduler; add `-Email` param to existing script | `Invoke-AssessmentReport.ps1` already exists; needs SMTP param and agent DDL |

### Design notes

- **Multi-server collector:** follow the same pattern as `MultiServer-Get*.ps1` scripts — parallel `Invoke-Command`, aggregate results with a `Server` column prepended. Credential handling via the existing `$env:DBASCRIPTS_*` env vars.
- **Baseline comparison:** CSVs already have consistent column names per script — diff logic is straightforward. Flag columns where delta exceeds a threshold (e.g. query duration +20%, missing index impact doubled).
- **Trend forecasting:** slope of the last N days of `collector.DatabaseGrowthCurrent` rows gives MB/day; divide remaining free space by MB/day for days-until-full. Already partially in `Get-DatabaseGrowthForecast.sql`.
- **Assessment scheduling:** lowest effort of the four — add `-EmailTo`, `-SmtpServer` params to `Invoke-AssessmentReport.ps1`, wrap in a SQL Agent job DDL generator (`Generate-AssessmentScheduleJob.sql`).
