# CLAUDE.md

This file is the working operating guide for this repository.

## Purpose

This repo is a production SQL Server DBA toolkit for Peter Whyte (sqldba.blog). Its identity: **AI reviewing SQL Server (one or many)** — health check data collection, a web UI dashboard to view and verify it, and copy/paste production DBA scripts underneath. Everything a DBA needs, with an AI helper to surface the blindspots.

The repo is built around four core ideas:

1. **The AI assessment is the flagship** — the healthcheck workflow (collect → rules review → AI assessment) is the repo's headline capability; the AI step is the point of the collection.
2. **Scripts first underneath** — the flagship rests on usable, copy/paste DBA tooling that works with no AI and no web UI.
3. **Run it directly when possible** — scripts should be understandable and runnable in isolation.
4. **Docs and outputs matter** — the repo should explain what a script does, what it returns, and what to do next.

The web UI is where collection output is viewed, verified, and diagnosed — part of the flagship workflow, though every workflow also works from the terminal alone. Multi-server ("the many part") is planned, not yet current scope.

## Operating rules

These rules apply across the repo:

- Prefer scripts that can be run from the repo **and** copied/pasted into a normal DBA workflow.
- **Copy/paste-first, zero dependencies:** a DBA who grabs one script (a patch runner, an SSMS
  installer, a trace, a monitoring query) must be able to run it right away. Where a script has
  an unavoidable precondition (e.g. traces need an existing output directory), say so in a script
  comment and/or terminal output — tell the user to create it or amend the parameter.
- Default to `.` / localhost unless a server is explicitly supplied.
- Preserve the intent of the script; do not change logic unless needed for safety, correctness, or readability.
- Prefer deterministic, readable, production-safe logic over clever shortcuts.
- Document purpose, permissions, expected output, and when **not** to use a script.
- Keep script docs and script behavior aligned so the output is trustworthy.
- Treat `output-files/` as generated runtime output, not permanent source content.
- **`mcp/src/sqldba_mcp/datasets/*.json` are GENERATED — never hand-edit them.** A correction
  typed into a dataset is lost on the next export and silently disagrees with the script or
  post it cites. Fix the source instead: a script's purpose or safety class in its `.sql`
  header here, an error or wait explanation in its post. `mcp/tests/check_freshness.py`
  re-derives the script, doc and prompt datasets from this repo and compares them byte for
  byte, so a hand-edit fails the build and names the file.
- **Script headers are a product surface, not tidiness.** `Author`, `Purpose`, `Requires`,
  `-- SAFE:` and `-- IMPACT:` are what an AI agent shows a DBA *before* they run something.
  A wrong or missing safety class is a public defect, not a formatting nit.
- Keep scripts easy to understand in isolation, even if the repo provides wrappers or launchers.
- Treat multi-server tooling as optional convenience, not as the main model for every script.
- Avoid overengineering and avoid adding complexity that hides operational intent.

## Naming and classification

- Prefer script names that describe the operational outcome first.
- Use one primary category per script or post.
- If a script is strong enough for a blog post, document it in a way that explains the problem, the output, and the DBA takeaway.
- Prefer one clear post per concept; avoid duplicating similar material.

## How to run scripts

Use the simplest path that preserves clarity:

- a script should be runnable directly from the repo
- a script should also be easy to copy/paste into a DBA workflow
- if a script targets a specific server, the script or wrapper should make that explicit
- the output should be understandable even without the web UI
- another DBA should be able to explain the script confidently during troubleshooting

The preferred entry points are:

```powershell
# 1. Root launcher — fuzzy name match, searches sql/ and powershell/
.\run.ps1 Get-WaitStatistics
.\run.ps1 Get-WaitStatistics -ServerInstance MYSERVER\INST01 -OutputFormat Csv

# 2. Direct wrapper — explicit path, passes all params through
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\powershell\wrappers\performance\Get-WaitStatistics.ps1 -ServerInstance . -OutputFormat Csv

# 3. SQL directly via the repo runner (for SSMS-style results in terminal)
pwsh -NoLogo -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\local-sql\Invoke-RepoSql.ps1 -ScriptPath .\sql\performance\Get-WaitStatistics.sql -ServerInstance .
```

Full healthcheck workflow (collect → rules review → AI assessment — the AI step is the
point of the collection; see `docs/ai-assessment.md`):
```powershell
# 1. Collect 45 scripts, save CSVs to output-files\healthcheck\<server>-<timestamp>\
.\powershell\reporting\Invoke-HealthCheckCollection.ps1 -ServerInstance .

# 2. Review the latest collection folder and surface CRITICAL / WARNING / INFO findings
.\powershell\reporting\Review-HealthCheckOutput.ps1

# Or target a specific folder
.\powershell\reporting\Review-HealthCheckOutput.ps1 -FolderPath ".\output-files\healthcheck\.-20260529-185000" -OutputFormat Csv

# 3. AI assessment — Claude API path (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; -DryRun previews the prompt)
.\powershell\reporting\Invoke-AiAssessment.ps1
```

**When a Claude Code session is asked for a health assessment, IT performs step 3 itself**
(instead of calling the API script): read the CSVs in the latest healthcheck folder, follow
`powershell\reporting\ai-assessment-rubric.md`, write the report to
`output-files\assessments\<server>-<timestamp>-claude-code.md`.

Preflight and discovery:
```powershell
.\tools\triage\Show-RepoOverview.ps1                          # inventory: script counts by category
.\tools\triage\Test-BranchesMerged.ps1                        # END OF SESSION: anything stranded on a branch?
.\tools\triage\Find-UsefulScript.ps1 -Keyword blocking        # find scripts by keyword
.\tools\local-sql\Test-SqlConnectivity.ps1 -ServerInstance .  # verify SQL connectivity
.\tools\maintenance\Clear-OutputFiles.ps1                     # wipe output-files\ before a fresh run
```

Migration DDL generators:
```powershell
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2019
.\powershell\migration\Generate-LoginScript.ps1
.\powershell\migration\Generate-AgentJobScript.ps1
.\powershell\migration\Generate-UserMappingScript.ps1
# Output: output-files\migration\*.sql
```

## Finish by merging, not by committing (2026-09-01)

**A fix committed to a branch and never merged is not shipped, and it is worse than not fixed,
because it looks done.** This bit twice in one day:

- `fix/trace-flags-resource-governor-services` was live on sqldba.blog but absent from `main`, so
  **the MCP server served 6 wrong trace-flag descriptions** and a classifier bug to every agent
  that asked.
- An em-dash fix landed on a branch at 10:21 and was **re-reported as an open defect hours later**
  by a session reading `main`. The second fix was character-for-character identical to the first.

Neither is a code defect, so no test could catch either. **Run
`.\tools\triage\Test-BranchesMerged.ps1` before calling a session done** (`-Remote` also catches
main committed but never pushed). It exits 1 and names the commits. **CI cannot do this job:** both
incidents involved branches that were local and never pushed, and a CI checkout cannot see them, so
a CI gate would have gone green through both.

**And before fixing a reported defect, check `git log --all` for it.** It may already be fixed on a
branch, which is exactly how the duplicate above happened.

## Blog / content guidance

Blog drafting does not happen in this repo and never should. The only thing that lands here is the
post URL, on the script's own `Author` line once a post is live (see **SQL script standards** below).
`docs/script-catalog.md` reads those lines into its Post column, so there is no second list to keep
in sync.

## Layout

**Use `sql/` or `powershell/` for all new work.**

                        Six tools — lookup_error, explain_wait, check_build, find_script,
                        get_script, answer_question — plus the docs as Resources
                        (`sqldba://docs/...`) and the health-check rubric as the MCP prompt
                        `sql-server-health-triage`. Independent installable package
                        (`pip install ./mcp`, entry point `sqldba-mcp`) depending on nothing
                        else in the repo, with no network and no SQL connection: the datasets
                        ship inside it, so it runs on an air-gapped box. Its own tests and CI
                        (.github/workflows/mcp.yaml), plus a scored retrieval eval
                        (`mcp/tests/eval_faq.py`).

## Running against a remote server

All scripts that call `Invoke-RepoSql.ps1` honour three session-level environment variables. Set them once with `Set-SqlConnection.ps1` and every script picks them up automatically for the rest of the session — no need to repeat `-ServerInstance` on every call.

```powershell
# Set remote server for this session (Windows auth)
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2019

# SQL auth (prompts for password)
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01 -Username sa

# Named instance with non-default port
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -ServerInstance "PROD01\INST01,14330"

# See what is currently active
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -Show

# Reset to local (.) Windows auth
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -Clear
```

Or pass `-ServerInstance` directly on any individual call:

```powershell
.\run.ps1 Get-WaitStatistics -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2019
.\powershell\wrappers\performance\Get-WaitStatistics.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2019 -OutputFormat Csv
```

Env vars used internally: `$env:DBASCRIPTS_SERVER`, `$env:DBASCRIPTS_USER`, `$env:DBASCRIPTS_PASS`. Explicit params always win over env vars.

### DDL generator scripts

`powershell/migration/Generate-*.ps1` scripts work differently from normal wrappers — they do **not** go through the CSV pipeline. They call `Invoke-Sqlcmd` with `MaxCharLength 2000000` (or `sqlcmd.exe -y 0`) to capture the full `NVARCHAR(MAX)` DDL string and write it to a `.sql` file in `output-files\migration\`. Never call these through `Invoke-RepoSql.ps1`.

```powershell
# Migration: generate all three scripts from source server
.\tools\local-sql\Set-SqlConnection.ps1 -ServerInstance PROD01\SQL2019
.\powershell\migration\Generate-LoginScript.ps1
.\powershell\migration\Generate-AgentJobScript.ps1
.\powershell\migration\Generate-UserMappingScript.ps1
# Output: output-files\migration\*.sql  — review, edit owners, run on target
```

## How PowerShell wrappers work

Every thin wrapper in `powershell/wrappers/<category>/*.ps1` follows this pattern:

1. Resolves `$repoRoot` as **three** levels up from `$PSScriptRoot` (wrappers sit at `powershell/wrappers/<category>/`)
2. Builds `$sqlScript = Join-Path $repoRoot 'sql\<category>\<Name>.sql'` (or `sql\migration\` for migration scripts)
3. Delegates to `tools\local-sql\Invoke-RepoSql.ps1` with `-ScriptPath`, `-ServerInstance`, `-Database`, `-OutputFormat`, `-OutputPath`

**Web UI contract:** A SQL script in `sql/` only appears in the web UI if it has a matching wrapper in `powershell/wrappers/<same-category>/<same-subfolder>/` (mirroring the sql/ path exactly). The wrapper IS the web UI entry point — the web UI launches wrappers, not SQL files directly. Every new SQL script must have a paired wrapper at the same relative path under `powershell/wrappers/`.

`Invoke-RepoSql.ps1` tries `Invoke-Sqlcmd` first (SqlServer module), falls back to `sqlcmd.exe`. Always writes a CSV to `output-files\reviews\<category>\<scriptname>-<timestamp>.csv` and prints a table preview. If neither tool is available it throws.

`run.ps1` resolves script by name fuzzy match → `& $target @Arguments`. It searches `powershell/`, `tools/`, `sql/` recursively. Throws if more than one match — callers must be specific.

**PowerShell script rules:**
- Classify script type in `.NOTES`: `runner` / `automation` / `hybrid`
- State target scope: `single server` or `multi-server`
- Classify risk in `.NOTES`: `RiskLevel : SAFE` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH IMPACT`
- Separate SQL logic from orchestration — SQL lives in external `.sql` files
- Add error handling; ensure idempotent behaviour where possible

## SQL script standards

Every SQL script must have this header block then the two safety annotations:

```sql
/*
Script Name : Get-ExampleScript
Category    : performance-troubleshooting
Purpose     : One-line description of what this returns.
Author      : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog)
Requires    : VIEW SERVER STATE
*/
-- SAFE:ReadOnly
-- IMPACT:Low
SET NOCOUNT ON;
```

`-- SAFE:` values: `ReadOnly` / `WritesData` / `CreatesObjects` — `-- IMPACT:` values: `Low` / `Medium` / `High`

Add `HealthCheck : Yes` (after `Requires`) to any script that runs as part of `Invoke-HealthCheckCollection.ps1`. This tag drives the "Health Check Suite" section in the web UI and makes membership machine-readable without needing a separate folder.

**Author URL rule:** The `Author` line uses `https://sqldba.blog` as a placeholder until the script has a published post. Once a post is live, update the URL to the specific post URL. Permalinks are **postname-only** (`/%postname%/`, since 2026-07-13) — the category is **not** in the URL, so the format is `Author : Peter Whyte (https://sqldba.blog/get-database-file-names-and-paths-in-sql-server/)` (not `/category/postname/`). Do this at the same time as marking the blog post `status: updated` or `status: published`. **The Author line is the ONLY blog link in a script header** — the old `-- Blog:` duplicate line was removed repo-wide 2026-08-14; do not reintroduce it.

**SQL script rules:**
- Remove or flag unsafe patterns: `WITH (NOLOCK)` (explain risk if present), deprecated catalog views (`sys.sysprocesses`, `sys.sysobjects` etc.)
- Prefer modern DMVs — `sys.objects` not `sys.sysobjects`, `sys.server_principals` not `sys.syslogins`
- No `USE database; GO` — `Invoke-Sqlcmd` does not support `GO` batch separators; pass `-Database` at execution time
- `OUTER APPLY` not `CROSS APPLY` when the applied function may return no rows
- No trailing blank lines; 0–1 blank lines at end of file
- Keep output readable and deterministic

## Adding new scripts

New SQL script: `sql/<category>/<subfolder>/Get-Something.sql` (or `sql/<category>/Get-Something.sql` if it belongs at the category root).

New PS wrapper: copy any existing wrapper from the same level under `powershell/wrappers/`. Path depth rules:
- `powershell/wrappers/<category>/` (root-level scripts) → `$PSScriptRoot '..\..\..'` (3 levels)
- `powershell/wrappers/<category>/<subfolder>/` (subfoldered) → `$PSScriptRoot '..\..\..\..'` (4 levels)
- Update `$sqlScript` to match the sql/ path exactly. The wrapper must be present for the script to appear in the web UI.

Use `New-Wrapper.ps1` to scaffold: it will need the category and subfolder to set the correct depth.

New orchestrator PS script (has real logic, not a thin wrapper): add to `powershell/<subfolder>/` (e.g. `reporting/`, `maintenance/`, `migration/`). Use `$PSScriptRoot '..\..'` to resolve repo root.

**When refactoring an existing script, summarise:** improved script, risk classification (`SAFE` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH IMPACT`), key changes (bullets), suggested folder placement.

**For each major script, document:** purpose in operational terms, example output interpretation, when **not** to use it, required permissions.

## Healthcheck collection — what it covers

`Invoke-HealthCheckCollection.ps1` runs 45 scripts and saves named CSVs. It also writes a
per-script `manifest.csv` (label, status, started, finished, duration) into the collection
folder, rewritten atomically after every status change — the web UI's `/api/status` polls it
for live progress, and it records per-script timings and failures for any later reader
(including the AI assessment). `-OutputFolder` targets an exact folder (used by the web UI);
otherwise the folder is `<server>-<timestamp>` under `-OutputRoot`.

`Review-HealthCheckOutput.ps1` reads those CSVs and fires on: databases not ONLINE, missing backups, full backup older than 24h (CRITICAL), stale log backups, tlog >80% used, auto-shrink, auto-close, percent-based autogrowth, DBCC CHECKDB stale >7 days (WARNING) or overdue >14 days / never (CRITICAL), any suspect pages (CRITICAL), SA enabled (CRITICAL), weak SQL login settings, I/O latency >50ms, specific wait type patterns (PAGEIOLATCH, WRITELOG, RESOURCE_SEMAPHORE, CXPACKET), max server memory unconfigured, data files <10% free, VLF count >200 (WARNING) or >1000 (CRITICAL), DBA maintenance job missing/failed/disabled, failed logins (locked accounts and repeated failures), Query Store switched to READ_ONLY, active user Extended Events sessions (INFO), CDC/Change Tracking warnings, Service Broker CRITICAL/WARNING status, databases at/near their configured growth limit, volumes <10% (WARNING) or <5% (CRITICAL) free, certificates expired/expiring, orphaned database users, xp_cmdshell enabled, error-log corruption/crash patterns (823/824/825/832, stack dumps) and memory-pressure patterns (paged out, error 802/701), AG replicas NOT_HEALTHY/DISCONNECTED or failing readiness, mirroring/AG endpoints not STARTED, inactive replication subscriptions, and recent failover-related error log entries.

## Important caveats

- AG scripts (`sql/high-availability/always-on/Get-AvailabilityGroupReplicaState.sql`, `Get-AvailabilityGroupLatency.sql`) guard against non-AG instances and return a status row instead of throwing.
- Multi-result-set SQL scripts cannot be cleanly exported as a single CSV via `Invoke-RepoSql.ps1`. All scripts in `sql/` are single-result-set by design.
- `output-files/` CSV files accumulate and should not be committed. Clear with `.\tools\maintenance\Clear-OutputFiles.ps1` before a fresh assessment run.
- `docs/standards.md` is the detailed standards reference — the header in this file is the condensed authoritative version. Keep both in sync when standards change.
