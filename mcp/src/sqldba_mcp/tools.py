"""The three tools, as pure functions.

Every one of these takes plain arguments and returns a markdown string. No MCP types, no I/O,
no globals. That means they can be unit tested directly, reused behind an HTTP API later, and
read by someone who has never seen the Model Context Protocol.

Two rules every response follows:

1. **Every answer ends with its source URL.** An agent quoting this should be able to cite it,
   and the reader should be able to go and check the working. That link is the whole point.
2. **Say what was assumed.** A build number does not state which servicing train it is on, so
   the tool names the train it picked. A DBA can spot a wrong assumption instantly; a silently
   wrong answer about patch level is worse than no answer.

    # list let an off-domain question reach far down it for anything with a word in common,
    # which cost more honesty than the promotion gained: 27/30 fell to 25/30. If the only
    # on-topic record is one the ranker put well below the top, that is the corpus saying it
    # does not really cover this. 0.85 keeps the transaction-log answer (10.59 against a top
    # of 11.37, 93%) and refuses the distant rescues.
    # ...and OVERRIDING the ranker costs more evidence than accepting it. Rank 1 passes on
    # any word in common. Promoting a lower-ranked record over BM25's own choice has to be

    # login" for a different post entirely.

    # does. "Borrowed vocabulary" is a claim about the pair's QUESTION, and it is testable:
    # a pair whose question already holds what was asked did not borrow anything. "how do
    # i get the sid of a sql login" had the verbatim pair "How do I get the SID of a SQL
    # login?" at rank 1, overlap 1.00, and this branch swapped it for the untrusted-domain
    # error post because that title shared `login` (0.31). Relative, not a constant: the
