"""Questions real people actually asked, and what the server must answer.

WHY THIS FILE IS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER SUITE HERE
------------------------------------------------------
`eval_faq.py` and `script_questions.py` build their queries FROM the corpus: take a
record, reword it, check the ranker finds it again. That measures the ranker and nothing
else, and it cannot fail for a record that is missing, mislabelled, or wrong.

On 2026-08-19 Peter asked nine ordinary questions. Six exposed defects. **129 unit tests
and all six eval suites were green the entire time**, because every one of those defects
lived outside what they can see:

  - the answering post existed and the tool quoted a footnote from it instead
  - the answering post was not in the corpus at all (74 published posts, 15%, are not)
  - the data was present and the input format was refused
  - a published fact was wrong
  - a heading was rendered that inverted the answer under it

So this suite asks from OUTSIDE. Every entry is a question a human typed, in the words
they typed it, with the answer judged the way they judged it. **Add to it every time
someone asks something real** - that is the whole mechanism. A question that passed is
worth keeping, because it is what stops a fix from silently regressing.

KNOWN-FAIL IS A FIRST-CLASS RESULT. An entry marked `gap=` documents something we have
decided not to fix yet, with the reason. It is reported separately and does not fail the
build. Deleting a failing question to make a number look better is the one thing that
would make this file worthless.

It fixed this question and was still reverted, because no threshold separated "this post covers your question" from "this post shares words with it" - coverage counted every term as worth 1, so:  book -> Kerberos vs NTLM scored 0.58 (answered), ports -> Default Ports scored 0.49 (refused). The false positive outscored the true one and the tier was correctly abandoned.  WHAT CHANGED IS NOT THE THRESHOLD. Coverage is now weighted by IDF, and the same two cases invert: book -> Kerberos 0.51, declined, because "book" is foreign vocabulary carrying weight 6.19 that can never be matched; ports -> Default Ports 0.65, answered, because "ports" is a real corpus term.
